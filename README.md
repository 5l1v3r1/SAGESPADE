# SAGESPADE
A fantastic macro structure that can be obfuscated easily 
per usage to ensure AV bypass. Works well against Windows 
systems, as well as email filtration checks. 

# Usage
Open up "sagespade.vbs" and add your base64 encoded payload
to the intended area. 

I recommend using an empire payload, or koadic. 
PoshC2 is also fantastic. 

Embed within a convincing document, such as a resum√®
or blurred spreadsheet.
